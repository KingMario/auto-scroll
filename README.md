Auto Scroll Chrome Extension
=============================

This Chrome Extension allows you to auto-scroll web pages by holding the Meta key (`⌘Command` on macOS or `⊞Win` on Windows) and double-clicking. The extension is designed to make scrolling through long web pages easier and more efficient.

Usage
-----

1. Install the extension from source.
2. After installation, navigate to any web page.
3. To initiate auto-scrolling, double-click anywhere on the page while holding the Meta key. The page will scroll down smoothly.
4. To adjust the scroll speed, hold the Meta key while double-clicking. If you also press the `⇧Shift` key, the scroll speed will decrease. Adjusting the scroll speed to 0 will stop the auto-scrolling.
5. The scroll speed will cycle back to 0 after reaching its maximum (4 pixels per 60 milliseconds), and vice versa.
6. Auto-scrolling will cease when the bottom of the page is reached or the scroll speed is adjusted to 0.

Features
--------

* Smooth scrolling for a better user experience
* Adjustable scroll speed
* Auto-scrolling stops at the bottom of the page

Note
----

This extension is designed to work on all web pages, but its functionality may be affected by certain page layouts or scripts that interfere with the scrolling behavior.
